# PhonePePulse
Process Involves - Cloning Github Data, ETL, Data Engneering, Data Wharehousing, Data Visuvalization, Dashboard developement(Streamlit & Plotly)
This project involves the following processes:
1. Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it..
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.
3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.
4. Creating a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. 
7. Some of the pictures of the dashboard are attached below:
